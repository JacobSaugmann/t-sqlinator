# Change Log

All notable changes to the "T-SQLinator" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-09-26

### MAJOR FIX: SQL Parsing & ORDER BY Alignment âœ…
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed window function parsing bug that was corrupting ORDER BY clauses
- **ORDER BY Formatting**: ORDER BY sections now show correct columns with proper comma-first alignment
- **Robust Parsing**: Improved SQL component parsing with accurate parentheses tracking
- **Window Function Support**: Window functions no longer break SQL structure or duplicate content

### Code Improvements
- **Enhanced parseSelectComponents**: Character-by-character parsing with accurate parentheses depth tracking
- **Improved formatWindowFunction**: Balanced parentheses counting prevents over-matching
- **Clean Codebase**: Removed debug files and test artifacts

## [0.7.0] - 2025-09-26

### NEW: Advanced Comment Handling
- **Intelligent Inline Comments**: Comments on the same line as code now stay on the line with proper tab spacing
- **Standalone Comment Spacing**: Comments on their own lines get 2 blank lines above and below
- **SELECT Column Comments**: Inline comments after commas in SELECT lists are correctly attached to the preceding column
- **WHERE Clause Comments**: Inline comments in WHERE conditions are preserved with proper formatting
- **Multi-line Comment Support**: Block comments (/* */) and line comments (--) are handled intelligently

### Comment Formatting Rules
- **Inline comments** (after code): Stay on same line with tab spacing
- **Standalone comments**: Get 2 blank lines above and below for visual separation  
- **Comments inside statements**: Preserved in their original location

### Fixed
- **Window Function Scope Issue**: Fixed issue where window function formatting affected regular SQL clauses
  - Window function formatting now only applies to SELECT column expressions with `OVER (` 
  - Regular GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and HAVING clauses are no longer affected
  - Made regex patterns more specific to avoid false matches
  - `formatOverClauseContent` now uses more precise pattern matching

### Important
Window function formatting is now correctly isolated to only SELECT column expressions containing `OVER (...)` clauses.

## [0.6.9] - 2025-09-26

### Enhanced
- **Advanced Window Function Formatting**: Complete redesign of window function formatting
  - Parentheses are now properly aligned: `OVER (` and closing `)` at same column position
  - `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `ROWS BETWEEN` clauses are perfectly aligned inside
  - Added `formatOverClauseContent` method for sophisticated multi-clause handling
  - Window functions now match professional SQL formatting standards

### Example
```sql
, SUM(e.Salary) OVER (
                        PARTITION BY e.DepartmentID
                        ORDER BY e.HireDate
                        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
                     ) AS RunningTotalSalary
```

## [0.6.8] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed multi-line SELECT parsing that was causing content loss
  - Updated regex patterns to use `[\s\S]*?` instead of `.*?` to properly match across newlines

## [0.6.7] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed

  - Improved `formatSimpleSelect` to preserve existing line breaks when formatting

## [0.6.6] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- **Comma Position Conversion**: Fixed issue where trailing commas in SELECT statements were not properly converted
  - Existing commas after column names are now properly removed when `commaPosition` is set to `before`
  - Ensures consistent comma positioning regardless of input format
  - Updated `formatComplexColumn` method to clean trailing commas

## [0.6.5] - 2025-09-25

        AND a.status = 'active'
    LEFT JOIN table_c c
        ON b.id = c.b_id
        AND c.deleted = 0
